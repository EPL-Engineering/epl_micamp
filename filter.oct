% define some scale
tera = 10^12
giga = 10^9
mega = 10^6
kilo = 10^3
milli = 10^-3
micro = 10^-6
nano = 10^-9
pico = 10^-12
femto = 10^-15

% what was the original -3db point?
freq_3db = 1/(2 * pi * (39*pico) * (49.9*kilo) )

% what should the new capacitor be assuming the new filter R is 2K Ohms
C_new = 1 / ( 2 * pi * (freq_3db) * (2*kilo) )
